# Digitizer
Digitizer is a Python script that creates new ASCII art images from jpgs or pngs.  

## Getting started
1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Add images to be digitized to the `inputs` directory.
3. From the project's root directory, run `python process.py`
4. The new ASCII art images can be found in the `outputs` directory.
